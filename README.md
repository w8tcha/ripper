## Features
### Auto Image Renaming
If there is already an Image with The Same name in the Current Download folder it will automatically renames the image and adds an "_xxx" to the Filename

## Auto Update
Ripper checks on Start if a new Version is available, and inform the user about a new Version. And will Automatically download and Restart the new Version.

## Check for already Ripped Posts
If this function is activated, every Post# you have ripped will be saved. And will be skipped if you try to download this post again. Its very useful when you Rip a Complete Thread but you only want to rip the newest Images which you don't already have. When you try to rip a single Post again Ripper ask you if you want to Rip this Post again.

## Clipboard Monitoring
Copy an Thread or Post URL (Or multiple Urls, As many as you want) to the Windows Clipboard. Ripper automatically picks them up and try's to Rip all Images

## Generates Sub folders
You Can choose between 3 Options where the Images should been saved.
* Downloads all Images to the Main Download folder you have chosen (Example: ..\My Pictures\)
* Downloads all Images to the Main Download folder but creates a sub folder for each Thread (Example: ..\My Pictures\Babe XYZ\)
* Downloads all Images to the Main Download folder but creates a sub folder for each Thread, Subforum and each Post (Example: ..\My Pictures\Celebrities\Babe XYZ\post# 01234 or if Post Title exists ..\My Pictures\Celebrities\Babe XYZ\PostTitle - If Post Titles are the same folder name will be renames as Post Title Set# X)

## Image Preview
The Last Downloaded Image will be displayed as Preview. If you double Click on it Ripper opens the Image in your Default Image Viewer.

## Multilingual
Ripper is multilingual (English, German, French). You can easily switch the language in the Options.
